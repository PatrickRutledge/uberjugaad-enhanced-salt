## Customer Business Email

```
From: Michael Thompson <mthompson@alphadistributing.com>
To: Sarah Johnson <sjohnson@uberjugaad.com>
Subject: RE: Order 0002456789 - Delivery Issues

Sarah,

We received the shipment for order 0002456789 yesterday, but there are significant problems:

1. Quantity delivered: 85 units (ordered 100 units)
2. 12 units show visible damage to packaging
3. Packing list doesn't match actual contents
4. No explanation for the shortage

This is the third delivery issue this quarter. Our production line is now at risk of stopping. 
We need an immediate resolution - either expedited replacement shipment or full credit.

If this isn't resolved by Friday, we'll need to escalate to our legal team and reconsider 
our Q3 orders (approximately EUR 2.3M).

Please confirm receipt and your action plan.
